+==========================================================+

Dawn was originally a project coming right off the heels of CC-Linux, one of my old projects. 
The idea was a CC OS kernel, but it ended up steamrolling into a full blown *NIX-Like OS for CC,
ith all the features and such. Everything in the idev branch is WIP, while everything in release
is fully stable and finished up. Of course, there's nothing in release yet, as this project is still
a WIP.

Current notable features:
- A very cluttered /etc/
- A decentralized logging system
- 3 libraries
- Two terminals
- like seriously /etc/ is a damn mess
- A registry
- /bin/ is notable ig
- package manager (pkg)
- A lot of bad and inneficient code, most of this damn thing needs a good rewrite

+==========================================================+

How to contribute:

1. Issues in Github

2. Forking and pull requesting
Fork the repo, make changes, then make a pull request. Code will be reviewed before acceptance.

3. Commiting to the repo directly
If you ask nicely, or make up to 5 useful commits and/or issues, you can be added to the list of contributors who can contribute
